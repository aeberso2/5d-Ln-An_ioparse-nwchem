# 5d-Ln-An_ioparse-nwchem
codes for parsing, generating output/input files in nwchem for our projects involving heavy element calculations

1. `inpgen-nw.py` holds main routines for input generation
1. `geom/` a place to store optimized geometries in either z-matrix or xyz format
1. `input_gen.h5` hdf5 file that holds the basis set, geometries and multiplicity information
